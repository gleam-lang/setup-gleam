# setup-gleam

[![](https://github.com/gleam-lang/setup-gleam/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gleam-lang/setup-gleam/actions)

A GitHub action that installs the Gleam compiler for use in your CI workflow.

Most likely you'll want to use this with another action to install the
Erlang/OTP runtime.
